-- A. Customer Journey
-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
-- Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!
/*
Customer 1 downgraded to the basic version after the trial week expired.
Customer 2 upgraded to the pro annual version after the trial week expired.
Customer 11 cancelled his subscription after the trial.
Customer 13 downgraded to the basic version after the trial and after 3 months upgraded to pro monthly.
Customer 15 probably forgot to cancel his subscription as it switched to pro monthly and got cancelled a month later.
Customer 16 downgraded to the basic version after the trial, but then upgraded to pro annual after 4 months.
Customer 18 probably forgot to cancel his subscription as it switched to pro monthly.
Customer 19 used pro monthly for 2 months after trial and upgraded to pro annual.
